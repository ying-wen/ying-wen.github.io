By leveraging auto-curricula to induce a population of distinct emergent strategies, PB-MARL has achieved impressive success in tackling multi-agent tasks. Despite remarkable prior arts of distributed RL frameworks, PB-MARL poses new challenges for parallelizing the training frameworks due to the additional complexity of multiple nested workloads between sampling, training and evaluation involved with heterogeneous policy interactions. To solve these problems, we present MALib, a scalable and efficient computing framework for PB-MARL. Our framework is comprised of three key components: (1) a centralized task dispatching model, which supports the self-generated tasks and scalable training with heterogeneous policy combinations; (2) a programming architecture named Actor-Evaluator-Learner, which achieves high parallelism for both training and sampling, and meets the evaluation requirement of auto-curriculum learning; (3) a higher-level abstraction of MARL training paradigms, which enables efficient code reuse and flexible deployments on different distributed computing paradigms. Experiments on a series of complex tasks such as multi-agent Atari Games show that Malib achieves throughput higher than $40$K FPS on a single machine with $32$ CPU cores; 5X speedup than RLlib and at least 3X speedup than OpenSpiel in multi-agent training tasks.

A cornerstone of this success is the auto-curriculum framework, which shapes the learning process by continually creating new challenging tasks for agents to adapt to, thereby facilitating the acquisition of new skills. In order to extend MARL methods to realworld domains outside of video games, we envision in this blue sky paper that maintaining a diversity-aware auto-curriculum is critical for successful MARL applications. Specically, we argue that behavioural diversity is a pivotal, yet under-explored, component for real-world multiagent learning systems, and that significant work remains in understanding how to design a diversity-aware auto-curriculum. We list four open challenges for auto-curriculum techniques, which we believe deserve more attention from this community. Towards validating our vision, we recommend modelling realistic interactive behaviours in autonomous driving as an important test bed, and recommend the SMARTS/ULTRA benchmark.","tags":["Multi-Agent Learning","Diversity"],"title":"Diverse Auto-Curriculum is Critical for Successful Real-World Multiagent Learning Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Mguni","Yutong Wu","Yali Du","Yaodong Yang","Ziyi Wang","Minne Li","Ying Wen","Joel Jennings","Jun Wang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, MARL has yet to penetrate settings beyond those modelled by team and zero-sum games, confining it to a small subset of multi-agent systems. In this paper, we introduce anew generation of MARL learners that can handle nonzero-sum payoff structures and continuous settings. In particular, we study the MARL problem in a class of games known as stochastic potential games (SPGs) with continuous state-action spaces. Unlike cooperative games, in which all agents share a common reward, SPGs are capable of modelling real-world scenarios where agents seek to fulfil their individual goals. We prove theoretically our learning method, SPot-AC, en-ables independent agents to learn Nash equilibrium strategies in polynomial time. We demonstrate our framework tackles previously unsolvable tasks such as Coordination Navigation and large selfish routing games and that it outperforms the state of the art MARL baselines such as MADDPG and COMIX in such scenarios.","tags":["Multi-Agent Learning","Potential Game"],"title":"Learning in Nonzero-Sum Stochastic Games with Potentials","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"SMARTS (Scalable Multi-Agent RL Training School) is a simulation platform for reinforcement learning and multi-agent research on autonomous driving.

Though practical, current methods rely on restrictive assumptions to decompose the centralized value function across agents for execution. In this paper, we eliminate this restriction by proposing multi-agent determinantal Q-learning. Our method is established on Q-DPP, a novel extension of determinantal point process (DPP) to multi-agent setting. Q-DPP promotes agents to acquire diverse behavioral models; this allows a natural factorization of the joint Q-functions with no need for \\emph{a priori} structural constraints on the value function or special network architectures. We demonstrate that Q-DPP generalizes major solutions including VDN, QMIX, and QTRAN on decentralizable cooperative tasks. To efficiently draw samples from Q-DPP, we develop a linear-time sampler with theoretical approximation guarantee. Our sampler also benefits exploration by coordinating agents to cover orthogonal directions in the state space during training. We evaluate our algorithm on multiple cooperative benchmarks; its effectiveness has been demonstrated when compared with the state-of-the-art.","tags":["Multi-Agent Learning","Diversity"],"title":"Multi-Agent Determinantal Q-Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ying Wen","Yaodong Yang","Rui Luo","Jun Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590681600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590681600,"objectID":"1c8a35ebc5ad15dc29e89e59e2991418","permalink":"https://yingwen.io/publication/gr2/","publishdate":"2020-05-29T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gr2/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a new reasoning protocol called generalized recursive reasoning (GR2), and embed it into the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework.

The GR2 leaners can take into account the bounded rationality, and it does not need the assumption that the opponent agents play Nash strategy in all stage games, which many MARL algorithms require. We prove that when the level k is large, the GR2 learners will converge to at least one Nash Equilibrium (NE). In addition, if lower-level agents play the NE, high-level agents will surely follow as well. We evaluate the GR2 Soft Actor-Critic algorithms in a series of games and high-dimensional environment; results show that the GR2 methods have faster convergence speed than strong MARL baselines.","tags":["Multi-Agent Learning","Opponent Modelling"],"title":"Modelling Bounded Rationality in Multi-Agent Interactions by Generalized Recursive Reasoning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ming Zhou","Jun Luo","Julian Villella","Yaodong Yang","David Rusu","Jiayu Miao","Weinan Zhang","Montgomery Alban","Iman Fadakar","Zheng Chen","Aurora Chongxi Huang","Ying Wen","et. al."],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Despite more than a decade of research and development, the problem of how to competently interact with diverse road users in diverse scenarios remains largely unsolved. Learning methods have much to offer towards solving this problem. But they require a realistic multi-agent simulator that generates diverse and competent driving interactions. To meet this need, we develop a dedicated simulation platform called SMARTS (Scalable Multi-Agent RL Training School). SMARTS supports the training, accumulation, and use of diverse behavior models of road users. These are in turn used to create increasingly more realistic and diverse interactions that enable deeper and broader research on multi-agent interaction. In this paper, we describe the design goals of SMARTS, explain its basic architecture and its key features, and illustrate its use through concrete multi-agent experiments on interactive scenarios. We open-source the SMARTS platform and the associated benchmark tasks and evaluation metrics to encourage and empower research on multi-agent learning for autonomous driving. Our code is available at this https URL.","tags":["Multi-Agent Simulation"],"title":"SMARTS: Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Training School for Autonomous Driving","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ying Wen","Yaodong Yang","Rui Luo","Jun Wang","Wei Pan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575129600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575129600,"objectID":"84d5ce6824894e52549bf81f636ebec0","permalink":"https://yingwen.io/publication/pr2k/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pr2k/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic recursive reasoning (PR2) framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our hypothesis is that it is beneficial for each agent to account for how the opponents would react to its future behaviors. Under the PR2 framework, we adopt variational Bayes methods to approximate the opponents' conditional policy, to which each agent finds the  best response and then improve their own policy. We develop  decentralized-training-decentralized-execution  algorithms, PR2-Q and PR2-Actor-Critic, that are proved to converge in the self-play scenario when there is one Nash equilibrium.  Our methods are tested on both the matrix game and the differential game, which have a non-trivial equilibrium where common gradient-based methods fail to converge. Our experiments show that it is critical to reason about how the opponents believe about what the agent believes. We expect our work to contribute a new idea of modeling the opponents to the multi-agent reinforcement learning community.","tags":["Multi-Agent Learning","Opponent Modelling"],"title":"Probabilistic Recursive Reasoning for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

We derive a variational lower bound of the likelihood of achieving the optimality and name it as Regularized Opponent Model with Maximum Entropy Objective (ROMMEO). From ROMMEO, we present a novel perspective on opponent modeling and show how it can improve the performance of training agents theoretically and empirically in cooperative games. To optimize ROMMEO, we first introduce a tabular Q-iteration method ROMMEO-Q with proof of convergence. We extend the exact algorithm to complex environments by proposing an approximate version, ROMMEO-AC. We evaluate these two algorithms on the challenging iterated matrix game and differential game respectively and show that they can outperform strong MARL baselines.","tags":["Multi-Agent Learning","Opponent Modelling"],"title":"A Regularized Opponent Model with Maximum Entropy Objective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ying Wen"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

Our intention is to put intelligent agents into a simulated natural context and verify if the principles developed in the real world could also be used in understanding an artificially-created intelligent population. To achieve this, we simulate a large-scale predator-prey world, where the laws of the world are designed by only the findings or logical equivalence that have been discovered in nature. We endow the agents with the intelligence based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In order to scale the population size up to millions agents, a large-scale DRL training platform with redesigned experience buffer is proposed. Our results show that the population dynamics of AI agents, driven only by each agent's individual self-interest, reveals an ordered pattern that is similar to the Lotka-Volterra model studied in population biology. We further discover the emergent behaviors of collective adaptations in studying how the agents' grouping behaviors will change with the environmental resources.

Efficient learning for intra-agent communication and coordination is an indispensable step towards general AI. In this paper, we take StarCraft combat game as a case study, where the task is to coordinate multiple agents as a team to defeat their enemies. To maintain a scalable yet effective communication protocol, we introduce a Multiagent Bidirectionally-Coordinated Network (BiCNet ['bIknet]) with a vectorised extension of actor-critic formulation. We show that BiCNet can handle different types of combats with arbitrary numbers of AI agents for both sides. Our analysis demonstrates that without any supervisions such as human demonstrations or labelled data, BiCNet could learn various types of advanced coordination strategies that have been commonly used by experienced game players. In our experiments, we evaluate our approach against multiple baselines under different scenarios; it shows state-of-the-art performance, and possesses potential values for large-scale real-world applications.","tags":["MARL"],"title":"Multiagent Bidirectionally-Coordinated Nets: Emergence of Human-level Coordination in Learning to Play StarCraft Combat Games","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yanru Qu","Han Cai","Kan Ren","Weinan Zhang","Yong Yu","Ying Wen","Jun Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1481472000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481472000,"objectID":"6f91d5b5c912367ded885905859ab91b","permalink":"https://yingwen.io/publication/pnn/","publishdate":"2016-12-12T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pnn/","section":"publication","summary":"Predicting user responses, such as clicks and conversions, is of great importance and has found its usage inmany Web applications including recommender systems, webs earch and online advertising. The data in those applications is mostly categorical and contains multiple fields, a typical representation is to transform it into a high-dimensional sparse binary feature representation via one-hot encoding. Facing with the extreme sparsity, traditional models may limit their capacity of mining shallow patterns from the data, i.e. low-order feature combinations. Deep models like deep neural networks, on the other hand, cannot be directly applied for the high-dimensional input because of the huge feature space. In this paper, we propose a Product-based Neural Networks (PNN) with an embedding layer to learn a distributed representation of the categorical data, a product layer to capture interactive patterns between interfieldcategories, and further fully connected layers to explore high-order feature interactions. Our experimental results on two-large-scale real-world ad click datasets demonstrate that PNNs consistently outperform the state-of-the-art models on various metrics.","tags":["Computational Advertising"],"title":"Product-based Neural Networks for User Response Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ying Wen","Weinan Zhang","Rui Luo","Jun Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1466524800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1466524800,"objectID":"9454627c28bbbf454bac3972cbd7a97a","permalink":"https://yingwen.io/publication/rcnn-hw/","publishdate":"2016-06-22T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/rcnn-hw/","section":"publication","summary":"Recently, the rapid development of word embedding and neural networks has brought new inspiration to various NLP and IR tasks. In this paper, we describe a staged hybrid model combining Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) with highway layers. The highway network module is incorporated in the middle takes the output of the bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-RNN) module in the first stage and provides the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module in the last stage with the input. The experiment shows that our model outperforms common neural network models (CNN, RNN, Bi-RNN) on a sentiment analysis task. Besides, the analysis of how sequence length influences the RCNN with highway layers shows that our model could learn good representation for the long text.","tags":["IR"],"title":"Learning Text Representation Using Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network with Highway Layers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ying Wen","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.
